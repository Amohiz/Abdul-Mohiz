## An introduction 🤝🏼
My name is **Abdul Mohiz** (spelled عبدالمعز and pronounced Abdul Mohiz). I graduated from UC Berkeley May 2022, and currently am on the path to grow in my career! Go Bears!  


## My background 💁🏻‍♂️
🌁 Born in Pakistan 🇵🇰 and raised in Richmond, CA (East Bay Area)  
🧳 Migrated to the United States when I was two- went to Murphy Elementary => Portola Middle => EC High => UC Berkeley  
🐻 Began my college journey at Cal as an undergrad pursuing Political Economics   
💻 Shortly after, I took my first Intro to Economics class taught by Professor Olney, I became really drawn to it.

❓ But what's next? I'm currently exploring opportunities that apply agile problem-solving, creativity, and technical skills to resolve difficult and nebulous issues, primarily in the fields of data science, data engineering, and data/product analytics

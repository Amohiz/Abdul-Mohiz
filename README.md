## An introduction 🤝🏼
My name is **Abdul Mohiz** (spelled عبدالمعز and pronounced Abdul Mohiz). I graduated from UC Berkeley May 2022, and currently am on the path to grow in my career! Go Bears!  


## My background 💁🏻‍♂️
🌁 Born in Pakistan 🇵🇰 and raised in Richmond, CA (East Bay Area). Being born in Pakistan and migrating to the United States as a two-year-old with my mother while my father working day and night taught me the importance of hard work. My mother being a homemaker taught me the values of life. Being an only child, I was to fend for myself and it resulted in me becoming the first in my family to attend college, making me a first-generation college student. 
Because of the number of struggles my family went through, I found my motivation; my family. I keen on becoming successful. However, I'm still grateful for these struggles because if it weren’t for these struggles, I may have never co-founded a clothing brand, SalamNation as a junior in high school or be admitted to UC Berkeley right after highschool, and give back to my community with any means possible.
🧳 Murphy Elementary => Portola Middle => EC High => UC Berkeley => JonesIT => What's next? 
🐻 Began my college journey at Cal as an undergrad pursuing Political Economics   
💻 Shortly after, I took my first Intro to Economics class taught by Professor Olney, I became really drawn to it.       
❓ But what's next? I'm currently exploring opportunities that apply agile problem-solving, creativity, and technical skills to resolve difficult and nebulous issues, primarily in the fields of data science, data engineering, and data/product analytics

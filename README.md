## An introduction 🤝🏼
My name is **Abdul Mohiz** (spelled عبدالمعز and pronounced Abdul Mohiz). I am the only child and I come from a low income household. Being born in Pakistan and migrating to the United States as a two-year-old with my mother while my father working day and night taught me the importance of hard work. My mother being a homemaker taught me the values of life. Being an only child, I was to fend for myself and it resulted in me becoming the first in my family to attend college, making me a first-generation college student. 

Because of the number of struggles my family went through, I found my motivation; my family. I keen on becoming successful. However, I'm still grateful for these struggles because if it weren’t for these struggles, I may have never co-founded a clothing brand, SalamNation as a junior in high school or be admitted to UC Berkeley right after highschool, and give back to my community with any means possible. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2022, and I currently am on the path to grow in my career! Go Bears!  


## My background 💁🏻‍♂️
🌁 Born in Pakistan and raised in Richmond, CA (East Bay Area)  
🧳 Moved to the states when I was two with my mother while my father was here working as a Taxi Cab Driver    
🐻 I started my college career at Cal as an undergrad studying Economics                                                                                    
📝Soon after, I enrolled in Professor Olney's Intro to Economics class; I was drawn to it, and the atmosphere of economics piqued my interest                  
🧑‍🏫 Worked various independent roles with Amazon, DoorDash, Caviar, etc, to support the family while being a full time student      
🔋 My first full-time job was at JonesIT (https://www.itjones.com) during my final semester at Cal. I am currently employed there as an IT Consultant. In my spare time, I enjoy learning Python and hope to attain new skills that will help me advance in the corporate world                                         
❓ But what's next? I'm currently exploring opportunities that apply agile problem-solving, creativity, and technical skills to resolve difficult and nebulous issues, primarily in the fields of data analyst, product management, and entry level programming and wherever my skills take me

## An introduction 🤝🏼
My name is **Abdul Mohiz** (spelled عبدالمعز and pronounced Abdul Mohiz). I am the only child and I come from a low income household. I'm also the first in my family to go college. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2022, and I currently am on the path to grow in my career! Go Bears!  


## My background 💁🏻‍♂️
🌁 Born in Pakistan and raised in Richmond, CA (East Bay Area)  
🧳 Moved to the states when I was two with my mother while my father was here working as a Taxi Cab Driver    
🐻 Began my college journey at Cal as an undergrad pursuing Economics 
Shortly after, I took my first Intro to Economics class taught by Professor Olney- I became drawn to it   
🧑‍🏫 Worked various independent roles with Amazon, DoorDash, Caviar, etc, to support the family while being a full time student.      
🔋 My first full-time job was at JonesIT (https://www.itjones.com) during my final semester at Cal. I am currently employed there as an IT Consultant. However, in my spare time, I enjoy learning Python and hope to advance in the corporate world.

❓ But what's next? I'm currently exploring opportunities that apply agile problem-solving, creativity, and technical skills to resolve difficult and nebulous issues, primarily in the fields of data analyst, product management, and entry level programming and wherever my skills take me.
